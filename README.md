# Generic project outline:
- generic ble pairing / confing from linux cmd:
	- gattol, hcitool, hciconfig
		- docs: 
			- https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-hcitool/
			- https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/8-hcidump/
			- https://www.jaredwolff.com/blog/get-started-with-bluetooth-low-energy/
			- http://joost.damad.be/2013/08/experiments-with-bluetooth-low-energy.html
			- https://github.com/pcborenstein/bluezDoc/wiki/hcitool-and-gatttool-example
		- useful if you have to scan the surroundings because you don't know which devices are available nor their properties
		- it listens for advertisements, tries to connect, and if possible enumerates the services
	- BLEAH
		- docs: https://github.com/nu11p0inter/bleah
		- a BLE scanner, can help in doing the aforementioned things
- once paired, start tampering:
	- Btlejuice:
		- docs: https://github.com/nu11p0inter/btlejuice
		- it is a complete framework for man in the middle attacks; includes an interceptor and a proxy to show what it intercepted.
	- GATTacker
		- docs: https://github.com/securing/gattacker
		- much more powerful & complex tool for MITM & other attacks
				
- purpose of this project: assess security of BLE devices
	- outcome depends on the BLE device
		- it can simply be a proof of concept if we buy simple BLE adapters (they are not real devices, we just show that the protocol is weak)
		- can be something more if we find wearable devices, locks, smart home appliances to test this with
	- requires BLE protocol knowledge (at first it is not so user-friendly)
	- those tools can also run on a raspberry pi
