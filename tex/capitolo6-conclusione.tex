The most striking fact about BLE devices is probably the overgrowing interest in Smart appliances adoption that does not correspond in any way to a growing interesting of its security (based on a 2012-2015 Survey from Google Trends).

It is definitely necessary for the public to gain awareness of the possible attack scenarios and risks that smart devices may imply.
Vendors' claims on security should also be reviewed by independent assessment as it is not always trustworthy.

With this project we tried to approach BLE devices trying to emphasize security aspects, from the simpler to more complex ones using the tools we had available and different platforms.

The possibilities for future implementations are surely varied and numerous, starting from using Btlejuice and Gattool to test devices, or using the even more powerful STM Iot Nodes to achieve different results.
They are complex tools and as such they require a discreet amount of dedication and attention, but it will be surely interesting to see what can be achieved with them.
