\begin{itemize}
	\item Integrity is granted for the policy in plain text by sharing its digest, encrypted with the Trusted Authority's public key.
	\item Confidentiality is granted both for the personal data, which is shared encrypted, and for its symmetric key which is encrypted together with the policy's digest
	\item Non-refusal is granted for all of the shared data thanks to the signing function applied by the data owner.
\end{itemize}

To decrypt Alice's data, Bob must follow these steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bob asks the Trust Authority to release the symmetric key, presenting the encrypted data signed by Alice.
	\item The Trust Authority evaluates the policy and Bob's reliability, submitting some challenges for him to complete.
	\item If trusted, Bob receives the symmetric key to decrypt Alice's personal data.
\end{itemize}
